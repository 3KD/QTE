# Unit 28 â€” Cross-Backend Receipt Comparator (A/B diff)

Compares two receipts (e.g., Exec Unit04 + Quentroy Unit06 blobs) produced on different backends/runs/time windows. Emits a deterministic diff JSON with distances / divergence stats and a quick verdict.

## CONTRACT (DO NOT CHANGE)
CLI subcommand and flags that MUST appear literally in `nvqa_cli.py`:
- nve-receipt-diff
- --a
- --b
- --out-diff
- diff_version="Unit28"

### Required Diff JSON fields (verbatim keys must exist)
{
  "diff_version": "Unit28",

  "distance_ok": true,

}

### Determinism
- Deterministic given two fixed receipts.
- Live generation of receipts is out of scope here; this unit only compares artifacts.
- Live end-to-end exercises are **opt-in** via `NVQA_LIVE=1`.

### Notes
- Inputs `--a` and `--b` accept JSON receipts produced by your pipeline.
- `distance_ok` is a boolean decision from fixed thresholds codified in code/tests.
