Unit 04 LIVE backend contract test (ibm_torino)

This is an optional hardware validation. It is SKIPPED unless NVQA_LIVE=1
is set in the environment. That way normal pytest / pre-push stays fast
and offline-safe.

What we prove when NVQA_LIVE=1:
  - we can talk to IBM Quantum using ~/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json
    (token/channel/instance already on disk, not hardcoded here)
  - we can pick backend "ibm_torino"
  - we can submit a trivial circuit (|00...0>, maybe H on qubit0)
    with a declared shot count
  - we can collect real hardware counts
  - we can build a RunReceipt dict that matches Unit04.md's CONTRACT:
        {
          "receipt_version": "Unit04",
          "backend_name": "ibm_torino",
          "shots": SHOTS,
          "rail_layout": "...",
          "endianness": "little",
          "qft_kernel_sign": "+",
          "counts": { "000...": n, "001...": m, ... }
        }
    NOTE: rail_layout here is a placeholder string describing mapping
    between semantic rails and physical qubits. We don't derive full
    loader/rail map yet. We just prove that we *emit* this field, because
    Unit04.md says ExecSpec/RunReceipt MUST carry it for Quentroy,
    payload audit, etc.

  - we assert basic sanity:
      * receipt_version == "Unit04"
      * backend_name == "ibm_torino"
      * shots is the same integer we asked for
      * counts is non-empty and sums to shots
      * endianness == "little"
      * qft_kernel_sign == "+"

We do NOT:
  - assert exact probabilities (hardware noise)
  - assert specific rail_layout format beyond "it exists and is str"
  - mutate any state upstream
  - leak your token; we rely on qiskit reading ~/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json

Manual run:
    export NVQA_LIVE=1
    pytest tests/test_unit04_live_backend.py::test_ibm_torino_exec_roundtrip -q

If that passes, we have *real proof* that Unit04 EXEC actually works
against IBM, not just on simulator.
